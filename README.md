Concertina Path finder


:: I will republish the script later ::



This scripts searches for a way to play a (irish) tune on a concertina

It needs an .abc file as input. Output is a series of buttons, with push/pull added. 
https://thesession.org/  had many .abc files, but therae are many other sites. 

For plotting results, chunky_png is needed. See .png for an example. Red is Pull, Blue is Push.

Please note:  
 1. $tinakeys  depends on YOUR concertina. The note of the buttons on yours can be different from mine!
 2. this scripts only plots a few winners;
